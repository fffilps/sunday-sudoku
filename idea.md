# Sudoku App

1. main thing - make the features work
    - DONE: UI - that allows clicking and adding buttons to squares 
        - UPGRADE: Offer drag and drop and better UI/UX
    - Create a solved one and then remove numbers ( a base count )
    - Should be able to type in the numbers/type when changing types of puzzle.
2. then decide the platform ( options: iOS, React-Native/Expo, Next.js)
    - seems like react native would be best option for all devices including web.
3. How to then make social and maybe ai creating levels and increasing difficulty - (ideally by reducing number of given numbers to a baseline. Im sure there is a number online to find.)
    - Google min number needed
    - supabase/vercel for oath
4. Themes and design will be needed if consumer and social.
    - its halloween season so lets do spooky theme first.
5. Add other harder sudoku variations.

## From v0: 
Let's start by creating the core Sudoku game component:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Game" file="sudoku-game.tsx"
...
```

This component creates a basic Sudoku game with the following features:

1. A 9x9 grid representing the Sudoku board
2. Ability to select a cell and input numbers
3. Validation of moves to ensure they follow Sudoku rules
4. A reset button to start a new game
5. A win condition check


To build towards a Candy Crush-like platform and AI-generated levels, you can expand on this base in the following ways:

1. Implement a level system:

1. Create multiple pre-defined Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulties
2. Add a level selection screen
3. Track player progress through levels



2. Add a scoring system:

1. Award points for correct number placements
2. Implement time-based scoring
3. Create a leaderboard



3. Introduce power-ups or hints:

1. Add a hint system that reveals a correct number
2. Implement an "undo" feature
3. Create special power-ups that can clear a row, column, or 3x3 box



4. Implement AI-generated levels:

1. Create an algorithm to generate valid Sudoku puzzles
2. Implement difficulty scaling based on the player's skill level
3. Use machine learning to analyze player behavior and generate personalized puzzles



5. Add visual enhancements:

1. Implement animations for number placements and completions
2. Create a more visually appealing design with themes
3. Add sound effects and background music



6. Implement a save system:

1. Allow players to save their progress
2. Implement daily challenges or puzzles





To start working towards AI-generated levels, you could begin by implementing a simple Sudoku generator. Here's a basic example of how you might approach this:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Generator" file="sudoku-generator.ts"
...
```

This generator creates a fully solved Sudoku grid and then removes a number of cells based on the desired difficulty level. You can integrate this into your game component to generate new puzzles:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Game" file="sudoku-game.tsx"
...
```

This implementation provides a foundation for your Sudoku game with generated puzzles. From here, you can continue to enhance the game by adding more features, improving the UI, and refining the puzzle generation algorithm. As you progress, you can explore more advanced AI techniques for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles, potentially using machine learning models to create even more engaging and personalized gameplay experiences.

## Perplexity Feedback

Symmetry:
Some Sudoku puzzles maintain symmetry for aesthetic reasons. You could implement this by removing cells in symmetric pairs.
Performance optimization:
For larger-scale generation, you might want to implement more advanced techniques like dancing links algorithm (Algorithm X) for faster solving and generation.
Difficulty estimation:
Instead of basing difficulty solely on the number of empty cells, you could implement a more sophisticated rating system based on the solving techniques required (e.g., naked singles, hidden pairs, etc.).
