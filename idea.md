# Sudoku App

1. main thing - make the features work
    - DONE: UI - that allows clicking and adding buttons to squares 
        - UPGRADE: Offer drag and drop and better UI/UX
    - Create a solved one and then remove numbers ( a base count )
    - Should be able to type in the numbers/type when changing types of puzzle.
2. then decide the platform ( options: iOS, React-Native/Expo, Next.js)
    - seems like react native would be best option for all devices including web.
3. How to then make social and maybe ai creating levels and increasing difficulty - (ideally by reducing number of given numbers to a baseline. Im sure there is a number online to find.)
    - Google min number needed
    - supabase/vercel for oath
4. Themes and design will be needed if consumer and social.
    - its halloween season so lets do spooky theme first.
5. Add other harder sudoku variations.

## From v0: 
Let's start by creating the core Sudoku game component:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Game" file="sudoku-game.tsx"
...
```

This component creates a basic Sudoku game with the following features:

1. A 9x9 grid representing the Sudoku board
2. Ability to select a cell and input numbers
3. Validation of moves to ensure they follow Sudoku rules
4. A reset button to start a new game
5. A win condition check


To build towards a Candy Crush-like platform and AI-generated levels, you can expand on this base in the following ways:

1. Implement a level system:

1. Create multiple pre-defined Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulties
2. Add a level selection screen
3. Track player progress through levels



2. Add a scoring system:

1. Award points for correct number placements
2. Implement time-based scoring
3. Create a leaderboard



3. Introduce power-ups or hints:

1. Add a hint system that reveals a correct number
2. Implement an "undo" feature
3. Create special power-ups that can clear a row, column, or 3x3 box



4. Implement AI-generated levels:

1. Create an algorithm to generate valid Sudoku puzzles
2. Implement difficulty scaling based on the player's skill level
3. Use machine learning to analyze player behavior and generate personalized puzzles



5. Add visual enhancements:

1. Implement animations for number placements and completions
2. Create a more visually appealing design with themes
3. Add sound effects and background music



6. Implement a save system:

1. Allow players to save their progress
2. Implement daily challenges or puzzles





To start working towards AI-generated levels, you could begin by implementing a simple Sudoku generator. Here's a basic example of how you might approach this:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Generator" file="sudoku-generator.ts"
...
```

This generator creates a fully solved Sudoku grid and then removes a number of cells based on the desired difficulty level. You can integrate this into your game component to generate new puzzles:

```typescriptreact project="Sudoku Game" file="sudoku-game.tsx"
...
```

This implementation provides a foundation for your Sudoku game with generated puzzles. From here, you can continue to enhance the game by adding more features, improving the UI, and refining the puzzle generation algorithm. As you progress, you can explore more advanced AI techniques for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles, potentially using machine learning models to create even more engaging and personalized gameplay experiences.

## Perplexity Feedback

Symmetry:
Some Sudoku puzzles maintain symmetry for aesthetic reasons. You could implement this by removing cells in symmetric pairs.
Performance optimization:
For larger-scale generation, you might want to implement more advanced techniques like dancing links algorithm (Algorithm X) for faster solving and generation.
Difficulty estimation:
Instead of basing difficulty solely on the number of empty cells, you could implement a more sophisticated rating system based on the solving techniques required (e.g., naked singles, hidden pairs, etc.).

### Next Updates from Perplexity

Supabase appears to be a better fit for your project than Firebase. Here's why:
Open-source and flexible: Supabase is open-source, which means less vendor lock-in compared to Firebase. This makes it easier to migrate or scale your project in the future14.
SQL-based: Supabase uses PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database, which can be more suitable for complex queries and data relationships13.
Cost-effective: Supabase offers a transparent pricing model with a generous free tier, which can be more cost-effective as you scale13.
Cross-platform compatibility: Supabase works well with Next.js, React Native, and iOS, making it easier to develop across these platforms4.
Scalability: Supabase is designed to be scalable and can handle high-traffic applications34.
To make your project successful and reach your goal of $5,000 per month:
Focus on user acquisition and retention:

## Database Structure: 
users/
  {userId}/
    profile/
      username: string
      email: string
      createdAt: timestamp
    gameStats/
      totalScore: number
      puzzlesSolved: number
      puzzlesByDifficulty/
        easy: number
        medium: number
        hard: number

### Need a state managemnt (likely working with database):
(look in perplexity for this info parts)
1. set up supabase
2. user auth with state
3. functions to update game stats
4. implement the basic user context

## Realtime: 

Based on the search results, both Supabase and Firebase offer robust real-time data synchronization capabilities, but they approach it in different ways:
Supabase Real-time Capabilities:
Postgres Changes: Supabase uses a feature called "Postgres Changes" to listen for database changes and update clients instantly 12.
Presence features: Supabase includes features for tracking user activity, making it suitable for collaborative applications 1.
Technology: Supabase extends PostgreSQL with real-time functionality, enabling developers to listen to database changes instantly 3.
Scalability: Supabase can handle up to 10,000 concurrent clients, 2,500 channel joins per second, and 2,500 messages per second 2.
Distribution: Supabase provides a globally distributed cluster of real-time servers designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant 2.
Firebase Real-time Capabilities:
Cloud Firestore: Firebase uses Cloud Firestore, a real-time NoSQL database designed for seamless data synchronization 14.
Real-time Database: Firebase also offers a separate Real-time Database product, which was its original real-time solution 14.
Scalability: Firebase Realtime Database is limited to 200,000 simultaneous connections 2.
Integration: Firebase's real-time capabilities are tightly integrated with its other services, providing a seamless experience within the Firebase ecosystem 4.
Key Differences:
Database Type: Supabase uses a PostgreSQL database, which is relational, while Firebase uses NoSQL databases 14.
Query Capabilities: Supabase allows for complex SQL queries due to its PostgreSQL foundation, while Firebase's NoSQL approach offers different querying methods 13.
Customization: Supabase offers more flexibility for customization and self-hosting options compared to Firebase 3.
Community and Support: Firebase, being older and backed by Google, has a larger community and extensive documentation. Supabase, while newer, is rapidly growing and has a strong open-source community 3.
Both platforms excel in providing real-time database updates, but the choice depends on specific application needs and preferred database structure. Whether for social apps, collaborative tools, or live updates, both Firebase and Supabase offer robust real-time data synchronization 1.
The decision between Supabase and Firebase for real-time data synchronization should be based on your specific project requirements, such as the need for SQL capabilities, scalability expectations, and preference for relational vs. NoSQL databases.
